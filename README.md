# mob-trees
Project on model-based trees. Includes report describing the method and example code.

Model-based (MOB) trees are similar to CARTs except instead of predicting a single value in a node, the prediction is a regression model. In some situations, MOB trees can perform better than CARTs and be better suited to the problem (plus, they have a cool acronym!). Read the report to find an easy-to-follow yet detailed description of the method and its advantages/disadvantages. The code file contains example code to implement MOB trees and compare their performance to other common approaches, such as CARTs, random forests, and linear models.
